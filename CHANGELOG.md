## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive production readiness assessment report (`PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md`)
- Detailed analysis of architecture, performance, security, and scalability concerns
- Specific recommendations for production deployment preparation
- Timeline and cost estimates for production readiness

### Analysis Results
- Overall production readiness score: 2/10 (Critical Issues)
- Identified critical architectural flaws requiring immediate attention
- Documented performance bottlenecks that would cause failures under load
- Highlighted security vulnerabilities and missing authentication
- Assessed documentation quality (7/10 - well documented)
- Evaluated deployment configuration and DevOps practices

### Recommendations
- Minimum 8-12 weeks development required before production deployment
- Critical fixes needed: database integration, error handling, connection pooling
- Security hardening required: authentication, input validation, rate limiting
- Performance optimization needed: caching, async processing, load balancing

## [0.1.0] - Current State

### Implemented
- AI image generation via Freepik API integration
- NFT minting functionality on Solana blockchain
- Basic marketplace operations (list/buy NFTs)
- Wallet integration support (Phantom, Solflare)
- Docker containerization and deployment scripts
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Production deployment guides

### Known Issues
- No database persistence (data lost on restart)
- Memory leaks and performance bottlenecks
- Extensive use of panic-inducing operations (`unwrap()`, `expect()`)
- Missing authentication and authorization
- No rate limiting or caching mechanisms
- Single point of failure architecture
