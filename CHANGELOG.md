## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Production readiness assessment report
- Comprehensive analysis of system architecture, performance, security, and code quality
- Detailed recommendations for production deployment
- Successfully deployed development environment with working backend and frontend
- Integrated custom React + TypeScript + Vite frontend from external repository
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS styling and responsive design
- Solana wallet adapter integration (Phantom, Solflare, Torus wallets)
- AI image generation interface with real-time preview
- NFT minting form with wallet connection and fee estimation
- API proxy configuration for seamless frontend-backend communication

### Fixed
- Updated Rust toolchain from 1.81.0 to 1.91.0 to resolve `edition2024` compatibility issues
- Generated valid Solana keypair for development environment
- Configured proper environment variables for backend operation
- Restored original Connect Wallet button styling with glass-morphism design
- Maintained exact original styling: bg-white/5, backdrop-blur-sm, border-white/10
- Preserved responsive behavior and hover effects from original design
- Fixed AI art generation feature by configuring Freepik API key in backend environment
- Resolved "Failed to generate AI image" error by enabling proper API client initialization
- Fixed NFT minting functionality by correcting API endpoint mismatches
- Updated frontend API service to use v1 API endpoints (/api/v1/nfts/mint, /api/v1/fees/estimate, /api/v1/images/generate, /api/v1/health)
- Aligned frontend MintRequest and MintResponse interfaces with backend v1 API structure
- Resolved "Failed to mint NFT" error by fixing endpoint routing and request format compatibility
- Fixed AI image generation response handling by updating ImageGenerationResponse interface to match backend v1 API structure
- Updated CreateCollectionForm component to correctly access generated image URL from response.images[0].url
- Resolved "Failed to generate AI image" error by aligning frontend expectations with backend response format
- Fixed Vite proxy configuration to preserve /api prefix when forwarding requests to backend (removed incorrect path rewrite)
- Resolved recurring "Failed to generate AI image" error caused by proxy stripping /api prefix from requests
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed frontend API service to handle backend's ApiResponse<T> wrapper format
- Updated frontend request method to properly extract data from backend's {success, data, error, message} response structure
- Resolved image generation failures caused by response format mismatch between frontend expectations and backend wrapper

### Deployed
- Backend API server running on http://localhost:3001
- Modern React frontend running on http://localhost:3000 (replaces simple HTTP server)
- Swagger UI documentation available at http://localhost:3001/swagger-ui/
- All API endpoints operational and accessible
- Frontend-backend integration via proxy configuration (/api/* â†’ localhost:3001)

### Analysis Results
- Overall production readiness score: 2/10 (NOT PRODUCTION READY)
- Critical architectural flaws identified (no database persistence)
- Performance bottlenecks and memory leaks detected
- Security vulnerabilities found (private key exposure, no input validation)
- Extensive use of `unwrap()`/`expect()` causing potential panics

### Recommendations
- Estimated 8-12 weeks of development required for production readiness
- Critical fixes needed: database integration, error handling, security hardening
- Performance optimization and scalability improvements required

## [0.1.0] - Current State

### Implemented
- AI image generation via Freepik API integration
- NFT minting functionality on Solana blockchain
- Basic marketplace operations (list/buy NFTs)
- Wallet integration support (Phantom, Solflare)
- Docker containerization and deployment scripts
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Production deployment guides

### Known Issues
- No database persistence (data lost on restart)
- Memory leaks and performance bottlenecks
- Extensive use of panic-inducing operations (`unwrap()`, `expect()`)
- Missing authentication and authorization
- No rate limiting or caching mechanisms
- Single point of failure architecture
